# PR2_Level_Generator
Procedural level generators for Platform Racing 2.

The hash salts for level uploading and level passwords have been removed, as I am not allowed to share them. If you have access to these, simply edit MapLE.cs and replace "[salt]" with the appropriate values.
As a consequence of this, the tool cannot be used as-is to upload levels. You can, however, save levels locally and load them with PR2 Speedrun Tools (https://www.dropbox.com/s/chgq5fa36hl6th4/PR2%20Speedrun%20Tools.zip?dl=0).
